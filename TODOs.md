# TODOs

## UX Tasks (2026-02-21)

- [x] New Task panel: widen the dialog and prompt editor so long prompts are easy to write.
- [x] Integrate Message Bus into the main run screen and remove inner bus-list scrolling.
- [x] Tree density: use smaller left indentation offsets to win horizontal space.
- [x] Task row metadata: move rerun badge to the left side of the right-aligned metadata block.
