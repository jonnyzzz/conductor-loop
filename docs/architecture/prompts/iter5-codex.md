# Detailed Design Review

Your task is to review the detailed design documents in `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/`.

## Files to Review
- `agent-integration.md`
- `deployment.md`
- `frontend-architecture.md`
- `observability.md`
- `security.md`
- `concurrency.md`

## Task
- Read these files.
- Verify they align with `FACTS-*.md` (from `docs/facts/`).
- Check for stale info (e.g., "HCL is primary" -> should be YAML).
- Write your findings to `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/review-notes-C.md`.

## Instructions
- Ensure technical accuracy.
