# Data Flow Review

Your task is to review the Data Flow documents in `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/`.

## Files to Review
- `data-flow-task-lifecycle.md`
- `data-flow-message-bus.md`
- `data-flow-api.md`

## Task
- Read these files.
- Check for contradictions (e.g., does the API doc match the Message Bus doc regarding locking?).
- Check for missing steps (e.g., does Task Lifecycle mention Fact Propagation?).
- Write your findings to `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/review-notes-B.md`.
- If they look good, write "Data Flow: LGTM".

## Instructions
- Be critical but constructive.
