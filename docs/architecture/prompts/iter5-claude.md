# Architecture Review & Index

Your task is to create `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/README.md` and review the high-level docs.

## Task 1: Create Index
Create `docs/architecture/README.md` with a table of contents for all architecture documents.
- Group them logically (Overview, Data Flow, Subsystems, Operations).
- One-line description for each file.

## Task 2: Review
Read `overview.md`, `components.md`, and `decisions.md`.
- Check for inconsistencies.
- Verify they match the `README.md` structure.
- If you find major issues, write them to `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/review-notes-A.md`.
- If no issues, write "High Level Docs: LGTM" to `review-notes-A.md`.

## Sources
- `/Users/jonnyzzz/Work/conductor-loop/docs/architecture/` (list files)

## Instructions
- Create a clean, navigable index.
