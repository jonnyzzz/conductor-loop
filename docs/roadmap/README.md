# Project Roadmap and Planning

This folder contains the current project-evolution planning artifacts generated in the 2026-02-24 roadmap iterations.

## Roadmap Docs

- `ROADMAP.md`: quarter-based priority plan (P0 -> Q1, P1 -> Q2, architecture -> Q3, long-term ideas).
- `gap-analysis.md`: documented feature/coverage/issue gaps versus current code and binaries.
- `evolution-opportunities.md`: feasible product/workflow opportunities from swarm and run-history signals.
- `technical-debt.md`: deferred issues, spec drift, and coverage debt inventory.
- `quick-wins.md`: high-value slices that should fit in one run-agent session.

## Prompt Inventory

Execution-ready task prompts are in `prompts/tasks/` and are referenced by `prompt-file` in roadmap and facts docs.
