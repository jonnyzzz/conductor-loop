# Agent Backend: xAI - Questions

- Q: Which xAI model/agent should be targeted first for coding tasks, and what is the invocation method (API vs CLI)? | Proposed default: Research and select a coding-focused model; use REST API if available. | A: TBD.
- Q: Does the xAI backend require additional tool-calling or sandbox capabilities that need to be surfaced in run-agent? | Proposed default: Start with plain text completion; add tool-calling support later if needed. | A: TBD.
