# Agent Backend: xAI - Questions

- Q: How will OpenCode be configured to use xAI models when the integration is enabled post-MVP? 
  Proposed default: Provide a run-agent adapter that passes model/provider flags to OpenCode based on config.hcl. 
  A: Parked for now, we resolve it at the next release. Put to backlog as an open issue in ISSUES.md
