# Agent Protocol & Governance - Questions

- Q: How strict should agent exit timing be (max runtime)?
  Proposed default: Soft limit 15 minutes per run; require delegation after that.

- Q: Should the protocol enforce a standard format for FACT files (YAML/Markdown template)?
  Proposed default: Markdown with a short header: date, author, scope.

- Q: Do we need an explicit "git allowlist" per task?
  Proposed default: Optional file TASK_GIT_ALLOWLIST.md listing writable paths.
