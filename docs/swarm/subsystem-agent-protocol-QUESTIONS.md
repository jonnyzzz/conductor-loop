# Agent Protocol & Governance - Questions

- Q: How are "Git Pro" skills defined and injected into agent prompts/tooling? 
  Proposed default: Runner includes explicit git-safety instructions in the system prompt; optional tool wrappers can enforce safe staging. 
- No specific actions. We use basic descriptions to in the THE_PROMPT_v5.md to explain how to use Git. Add sections there for small logical commits.
