# Gemini Streaming Behavior Test

Your task is to help me test if the Gemini CLI supports streaming/unbuffered stdout output.

Please generate a response that takes at least 10-15 seconds to complete. Count from 1 to 50, with a brief explanation for each number about why that number is interesting (mathematically, historically, or culturally).

For example:
- 1: The multiplicative identity
- 2: The only even prime number
- 3: The first odd prime
... and so on through 50.

Take your time with each number. I'm monitoring stdout to see if your output appears progressively (streaming) or all at once at the end (buffered).

After you finish counting, please answer: Based on this exercise, do you believe your output was streamed in real-time or buffered?
