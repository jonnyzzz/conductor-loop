You are a sub-agent for ROUND 2 planning on a cross-cutting topic. The user says all current questions are answered, so propose NEW open questions only.

Read:
- ideas.md (newer answers higher priority)
- TIPICS.md
- relevant subsystem specs and QUESTIONS files for this topic

Task:
1) Treat all existing questions as answered; do NOT keep them.
2) Propose 2-5 NEW open questions that are not already answered in ideas.md/specs.
3) For each question, indicate which *QUESTIONS.md file it should live in.

Output format:
- Summary (1-2 lines)
- Add list: bullet entries in this exact format:
- <file>: Q: ...
  Proposed default: ...
  A: TBD.

Do NOT edit files. Do NOT run tests.
