You are a sub-agent for ROUND 2 planning. The user says all current questions are answered, so your job is to propose NEW open questions only.

Read:
- ideas.md (newer answers higher priority)
- subsystem-runner-orchestration.md
- subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md
- TIPICS.md (for cross-cutting alignment)

Task:
1) Treat all existing questions as answered; do NOT keep them.
2) Propose 3-7 NEW open questions that are not already answered in ideas.md or specs.
3) Keep questions precise, actionable, and likely to unblock implementation.

Output format:
- Summary (1-2 lines)
- Add list: bullet entries using this exact format:
- Q: ...
  Proposed default: ...
  A: TBD.

Do NOT edit files. Do NOT run tests.
