You are a codex sub-agent reviewing the swarm design docs after the latest updates.

Read:
- ideas.md
- SUBSYSTEMS.md
- TIPICS.md
- subsystem-*.md
- subsystem-*-QUESTIONS.md
- questions-history/*.md

Also check git history for TIPICS.md and a few subsystem specs/questions (git log -p) to ensure newer answers are reflected.

Task:
- Identify any contradictions or missing decisions across ideas.md, specs, and TIPICS.md.
- Identify any answered questions that are still present in *-QUESTIONS.md files (should be removed).
- Identify any missing open questions that should be added.
- Propose concrete spec updates (file -> bullet list).

Output format:
1) Contradictions/missing decisions
2) Questions to remove/resolve
3) New questions to add
4) Spec updates

Do NOT edit files. Do NOT run tests.
