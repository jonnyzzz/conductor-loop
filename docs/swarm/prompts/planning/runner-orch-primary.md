You are a sub-agent reviewing Runner & Orchestration docs.

Read:
- ideas.md (newer answers have higher priority)
- subsystem-runner-orchestration.md
- subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md

Task:
1) Identify questions in subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md that are solved/answered (A is not TBD or answer is clearly accepted) and should be removed.
2) Identify gaps/contradictions with ideas.md (newer) and spec; propose NEW open questions that should remain (A: TBD).
3) If an answer is already clearly given in ideas.md, mark it as solved (remove, do not re-add).

Output format:
- Summary (1-2 lines)
- Remove list: bullet points with exact question text to remove (copy Q line)
- Add list: bullet points with full Q/Proposed default/A: TBD (use the same formatting as QUESTIONS files)

Do NOT edit files. Do NOT run tests.
