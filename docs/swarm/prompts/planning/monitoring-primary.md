You are a sub-agent reviewing Monitoring & Control UI docs.

Read:
- ideas.md (newer answers higher priority)
- subsystem-monitoring-ui.md
- subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md

Task:
1) Identify questions in subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md that are solved/answered and should be removed.
2) Identify gaps/contradictions with ideas.md/spec; propose NEW open questions (A: TBD).
3) If ideas.md clearly answers a question, mark it for removal (do not re-add).

Output format:
- Summary (1-2 lines)
- Remove list: bullet points with exact question text to remove (copy Q line)
- Add list: bullet points with full Q/Proposed default/A: TBD
