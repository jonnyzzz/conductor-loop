# Task: Create Project Name for Agentic Swarm Orchestrator

## Context

We're implementing an orchestration system for multi-agent workflows based on the "Agentic Swarm" specification. The system coordinates multiple AI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Perplexity) to work together on software development tasks.

## Key Features of the System

1. **Ralph Loop**: Root agent restart loop for task orchestration
2. **Message Bus**: File-based inter-agent communication
3. **Run Management**: Hierarchical task execution with parent-child relationships
4. **Multi-Backend**: Support for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Perplexity, xAI
5. **REST API + UI**: Web interface for monitoring and control
6. **Storage**: File-based run storage with YAML metadata

## Current Name (Temporary)
`jonnyzzz-swarm` (too generic)

## Requirements for New Name

1. **Professional**: Suitable for open-source GitHub project
2. **Memorable**: Easy to remember and pronounce
3. **Descriptive**: Hints at orchestration/agents/coordination
4. **Unique**: Not conflicting with existing projects
5. **Short**: 2-3 words, hyphenated (e.g., `project-name`)
6. **Technology-neutral**: Doesn't lock into specific AI models

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Avoid: "ai-", "llm-", "chatbot-" prefixes (overused)
- Consider: orchestration, conductor, maestro, swarm, hive, nexus, relay, nexus, chorus, ensemble

## Your Task

Propose **5 project names** with brief rationales. For each name:

1. **Name**: The actual project name (lowercase-hyphenated)
2. **Full Title**: Expanded form (e.g., "Ralph Orchestrator")
3. **Rationale**: Why this name fits (1-2 sentences)
4. **Pros**: What makes it good
5. **Cons**: Potential issues or concerns

## Output Format

```markdown
## Option 1: project-name
**Full Title**: Project Full Name
**Rationale**: [Why this name]
**Pros**:
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]
**Cons**:
- [Con 1]

## Option 2: ...
[repeat]

## Recommendation
[Which option you recommend and why]
```

Focus on names that convey orchestration, coordination, and multi-agent collaboration.
