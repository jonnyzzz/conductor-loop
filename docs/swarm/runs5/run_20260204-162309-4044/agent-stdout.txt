I will read the core documentation and questions files to understand the current state of Topic 2: Run Lifecycle & Restart (Ralph).
1) External facts check
- No external verification required (standard Unix signals and Go patterns).

2) TIPICS updates
- **Topic 2: Run Lifecycle & Restart (Ralph)**
    - **Add Decision:** "Waiting" state is distinct from "Idle"; defined as "Last message bus entry is type QUESTION" (implies waiting for USER/ANSWER).
    - **Add Decision:** Task completion (DONE + children exited) results in `run-agent task` process exit. Revival/resume requires manual re-invocation (e.g., "Start Again" in UI).
    - **Add Decision:** `run-agent job` runs detached (setsid/pgid) but runner waits for exit; `run-agent stop <run_id>` sends SIGTERM to the recorded PGID.
    - **Clarification:** Root agent *logic* (the prompt/script) is responsible for polling/reacting to the message bus; the `run-agent` binary does not run a background poller thread itself.

3) Spec updates
- **subsystem-runner-orchestration.md**
    - **Update:** Under "Components / run-agent task", explicitly state that the process exits when the task is complete. There is no long-running "watch" mode after completion in MVP.
    - **Update:** Under "Idle / Stuck / Waiting", formalize the "Waiting" state definition (last message == QUESTION).

4) Questions to remove/resolve
- No questions to remove from `subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md` (the 2 existing ones are valid open backlog items).

5) New open questions
- **subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md**
    - Q: How is message bus compaction (merging/archiving) triggered? Is it a phase in the Ralph loop (post-run) or purely a user/agent-initiated task?
      - Proposed default: Deferred to post-MVP; initially manual or agent-scripted.
      - A: TBD.
