Perfect. Now I have all the information I need to provide the analysis. Let me compile the findings.

## Analysis Report: Agent Backend: Codex

### 1. External Facts Check

**Claim: Codex CLI command and flags**
- The spec references `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` command.
- **Verification status**: The web search confirms "Codex CLI" exists as OpenAI's CLI coding tool in 2026, but I could not verify the exact flag `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` through external sources. However, the reference implementation in run-agent.sh:42 confirms this flag is actively used in the project.
- **Assessment**: The command appears to be project-specific usage based on the actual implementation. No contradictions found with documented OpenAI Codex CLI behavior in 2026.

**No other external protocol/API claims require verification** - the spec correctly defers to CLI defaults and host configuration.

### 2. Spec Updates

**subsystem-agent-backend-codex.md**
- Line 16: Change "Command (current run-agent.sh):" to "Command (used by run-agent):" for consistency with Claude/Gemini backend specs (already done in current version).
- Line 28: Change "No sandboxing enforced; full tool access is allowed by default." to "No sandboxing enforced; full tool access is required (keep `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`)." - more explicit about the requirement rather than "allowed".
- Line 29: Add note that "run-agent does not override model/reasoning settings; host CLI defaults apply." (consistent with Claude backend spec:29).
- **New section needed**: Add explicit statement about working directory handling similar to other backends (it's implied by orchestration but should be explicit).

**subsystem-agent-backend-codex-QUESTIONS.md**
- Remove both questions entirely (both are answered).

### 3. Questions to Remove/Resolve

**subsystem-agent-backend-codex-QUESTIONS.md**

**Q1: Should run-agent allow overriding the Codex model and reasoning settings per task?**
- **Resolution**: No override in MVP. Use CLI defaults; defer configuration to host CLI config. Optional overrides via config.hcl are future work.
- **Answered by**: Cross-reference to "See Claude answers" plus consistent pattern across Claude (line 29), Gemini (line 29), and Codex specs.
- **Action**: Remove this question. Update main spec to clarify "run-agent does not override model/reasoning settings; host CLI defaults apply."

**Q2: Should the Codex adapter always run with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, or allow a safer mode?**
- **Resolution**: Yes, always use `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` in MVP. All agents run with full tool access; no sandboxing enforced per subsystem-runner-orchestration.md:16 and subsystem-agent-protocol.md (topic 4 in TIPICS.md).
- **Answered by**: Answer in QUESTIONS file references run-agent.sh as the authoritative example, and TIPICS.md Topic 4 confirms "No enforced sandbox, sensitive-path guardrails, or resource limits."
- **Action**: Remove this question. Update main spec to use stronger language ("required" vs "allowed").

### 4. New Open Questions

**subsystem-agent-backend-codex-QUESTIONS.md**

**Q: Should Codex-specific environment variables (API keys, auth tokens) use a standardized name in config.hcl or backend-specific names?**
- **Context**: subsystem-env-contract.md:47-48 states "Tokens and credentials are injected into agent processes from config; the naming is backend-specific and not standardized here." However, no documentation exists for the Codex-specific naming.
- **Proposed default**: Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (industry standard) or `CODEX_API_TOKEN` (project-specific). Document in config.hcl schema.
- **A: TBD** (implementation decision needed)

**Q: Does the Codex CLI support streaming output, and should run-agent capture streaming stderr for progress monitoring?**
- **Context**: subsystem-monitoring-ui.md (TIPICS.md Topic 6) specifies SSE streaming for UI, but backend specs don't clarify if CLI tools support streaming or if output is buffered.
- **Proposed default**: Treat Codex stderr as streaming for progress monitoring; flush behavior depends on CLI implementation. Document actual behavior after testing.
- **A: TBD** (test and document actual behavior)

**Q: What is the retry/timeout strategy for Codex invocations when the CLI hangs or times out?**
- **Context**: subsystem-runner-orchestration.md:108-112 defines transient error backoff but not CLI-level timeouts. Codex could hang indefinitely on network issues.
- **Proposed default**: Rely on idle/stuck detection (5m/15m) from orchestration; no explicit CLI timeout flag unless Codex supports it.
- **A: TBD** (verify Codex CLI timeout options)

---

### 5. New Docs/Topics Suggested

**No new dedicated doc required.** All Codex-specific concerns are adequately scoped within:
- subsystem-agent-backend-codex.md (invocation contract)
- subsystem-runner-orchestration.md (lifecycle)
- subsystem-env-contract.md (environment variables)

**However**, consider adding a **cross-backend comparison table** in subsystem-runner-orchestration.md or a new `subsystem-agent-backend-comparison.md` to document:
- CLI command patterns for each backend
- Full-access/bypass flags for each backend
- Streaming behavior per backend
- Known limitations/quirks per backend

This would reduce duplication and make backend-specific differences more discoverable.

---

### Summary

**Contradictions found**: None. The Codex spec is consistent with ideas.md, TIPICS.md, and sibling backend specs.

**Answered questions**: Both questions in the QUESTIONS file are now resolved and should be removed after updating the main spec.

**Spec gaps**: 
1. Model/reasoning override behavior not explicitly documented (defer to CLI defaults).
2. Environment variable naming for Codex tokens not specified.
3. Streaming behavior not documented.
4. CLI timeout handling not specified.

**Recommendation**: Update subsystem-agent-backend-codex.md with the spec updates listed in section 2, remove both questions from QUESTIONS file, and add the 3 new open questions listed in section 4.
