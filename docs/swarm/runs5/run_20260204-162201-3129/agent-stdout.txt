I will read the necessary documentation files and check the git history to gather context for the review.
I have reviewed the `Monitoring & Control UI` subsystem documentation, git history, and related topics.

The documentation is largely consistent, with `subsystem-monitoring-ui.md` reflecting the decisions in `TIPICS.md` and `ideas.md`. The primary open items are technical implementation details (build tools, embedding) which are currently listed as TBD questions.

### 1) External facts check
*   **Vite**: Validated as the current industry standard for React build tooling, offering superior performance to CRA.
*   **go:embed**: Validated as the standard Go 1.16+ mechanism for embedding static assets into binaries.
*   **JetBrains Mono**: Validated as an open-source (OFL) font, suitable for embedding or web delivery.
*   **SSE vs WS**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) is validated as a simpler, uni-directional transport suitable for log streaming, supported natively by Go's `net/http`.

### 2) Spec updates
I propose updating **`subsystem-monitoring-ui.md`** to formalize the implementation stack decisions:

*   **New Section: Implementation Stack**
    *   **Build Tool:** Vite (fast dev server, optimized production build).
    *   **Embedding:** `go:embed` directive to bundle the Vite `dist/` folder into the `run-agent` binary.
    *   **State Management:** React Context + Hooks (no Redux/Zustand needed for MVP).
    *   **Dev Workflow:** Vite development server (`npm run dev`) configured to proxy API requests (`/api`, `/sse`) to a running local `run-agent serve` instance.
    *   **API Contract:** REST for control/actions, SSE for state updates and log streaming. Types manually synchronized for MVP (Go structs <-> TS interfaces).

### 3) Questions to remove/resolve
All current questions in `subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md` can be resolved with the proposed defaults.

*   **subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md**
    *   `Q: Which build tool should be used...?`
        *   **Resolution:** Use **Vite**.
    *   `Q: How are frontend assets embedded...?`
        *   **Resolution:** Use **`go:embed`** on the built `dist` folder.
    *   `Q: What is the API contract...?`
        *   **Resolution:** **REST + SSE**. TypeScript types manually synced for MVP.
    *   `Q: What is the development workflow...?`
        *   **Resolution:** **Vite dev server with proxy** to Go backend.
    *   `Q: Do we need a state management library...?`
        *   **Resolution:** **React Context** is sufficient for MVP.

### 4) New open questions
*   **subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md**
    *   `Q: How should the UI handle 'Project Source Code Folder' presets?`
        *   **Proposed default:** Define a `project_roots` list in `config.hcl` that the UI fetches to populate the "Start New Task" autocomplete.
        *   **A:** TBD.

### 5) New docs/topics suggested
*   None. The scope is well-contained in `subsystem-monitoring-ui.md`.
