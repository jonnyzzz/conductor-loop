I will read the necessary design documents and check the git history to analyze the current state of the "Runner & Orchestration" subsystem.
I will re-read `subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md` to confirm its content.
Here is the review of the "Runner & Orchestration" subsystem.

### 1. External facts check
*   **Go Embedding:** `go:embed` is the standard and recommended way to bundle web assets (React build output) into a Go binary. Confirmed suitable for MVP.
*   **HCL in Go:** HashiCorp's `hcl` library is the standard standard for parsing HCL. Mapping to Go structs is the standard validation method.

### 2. Spec updates
**`subsystem-runner-orchestration.md`**
*   **Agent Backends:** Update `xAI integration` status from "pending research" to "Deferred post-MVP (see `subsystem-agent-backend-xai.md`)." (Aligns with git history decision).
*   **Components / run-agent serve:** Add "UI assets (HTML/JS/CSS) are embedded in the binary using `go:embed`." (Resolves open question in TIPICS).
*   **Components / run-agent (binary):** Add "Updates are handled via manual install/rebuild for MVP (no self-update mechanism)." (Resolves open question).
*   **Configuration:** Add "Schema is defined via Go structs and validated on load. Unknown keys log warnings." (Resolves open question).
*   **Components / run-agent bus:** Explicitly note that this subcommand supersedes the `post-message.sh` and `poll-message.sh` scripts mentioned in `ideas.md`.

### 3. Questions to remove/resolve
**`subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md`**
*   **Q:** How are run-agent binary updates/versioning handled...?
    *   **Resolution:** Manual install/rebuild for MVP. (Move to spec).
*   **Q:** Where is the config.hcl schema/version defined...?
    *   **Resolution:** Defined in Go structs, validated on startup. (Move to spec).
*   **Q:** (Implied from git history) What is the xAI integration strategy...?
    *   **Resolution:** Deferred post-MVP. (Move to spec).

### 4. New open questions
**`subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md`**
*   **Q:** What are the specific CLI flags for `run-agent bus`?
    *   **Proposed default:** `--wait` (poll for new), `--json` (structured output), `--tail` (streaming), `--filter` (regex).
    *   **A:** TBD

### 5. New docs/topics suggested
*   None. The scope is well-covered by the existing doc and `subsystem-monitoring-ui.md`.
