# Agentic Swarm Design

We notice that agents are much better to work on a smaller tasks. 
The longer it works, the more prompts we give to it, the harder it turns out
for the agent to pursue the initial attention and goals. 

In this project we approach it from the different angle, here is the agent swarm manifesto:
- agent should do a selected task and exit
- task can be of any kind, from coding, to managing
- we build the work as a chunk of recursive tasks
- on each level an agent must decide if it can work on the task or it should delegate the smaller task down to the hierarchy
- we have monitoring tool and see the actual delegation tree
- for communication, we include the [message-bus](../message-bus-mcp) as the solution
- we may include a dedicated polling service for the message bus post-MVP; in MVP the root agent polls
- message bus helps to track the progress, together with the git history and other artifacts
- agents seem to be quite clumsy with Git, and it means we need to offer Git Pro skills, so it can commit only selected files, without touching other files. Hope it can be done in the upper promts
- we designed the basic schema with ../THE_PROMPT_v5.md and the run-agent binary
- there should be no direct communication with agents, instead, one can only write to message bus
- we need monitoring tool, so we track all agent runs for all projects
- run different agents types each time to keep up the work

# Topics

This list captures the current planning topics derived from ideas.md, the subsystem specs, and historical Q/A. Topics are intentionally broad and cross-cutting. Each topic includes consolidated decisions and remaining open questions.

1. Message Bus Format & Threading
   - Decisions:
     - Format: append-only YAML front-matter entries separated by `---` (no legacy single-line compatibility).
     - Required headers: msg_id, ts (ISO-8601 UTC; distinct from compact filename timestamps), type, project; optional task/run_id/parents/attachment_path.
     - Types: FACT, QUESTION, ANSWER, USER, START, STOP, ERROR, INFO, WARNING, OBSERVATION, ISSUE.
     - Threading: parents[] links; append-only corrections/updates; parents[] supports string shorthand (implicit reply) or structured objects with explicit relationship kind.
     - Relationship kind values are free-form strings; tooling is permissive in MVP (see subsystem-message-bus-object-model.md).
     - CLI --parents accepts string msg_id lists only; structured parents objects are posted via REST.
     - Atomic writes via run-agent bus (temp + swap); direct writes disallowed.
     - Routing: separate PROJECT-MESSAGE-BUS.md and TASK-MESSAGE-BUS.md; task messages stay in task scope, project messages are project-wide; UI aggregates at read time.
     - Size: soft 64KB body limit; larger payloads stored as attachments in the task folder with timestamp + short description naming and attachment_path metadata.
     - Reader behavior: sequential scan with optional filter/regex; no cursor file.
   - Open questions (see subsystem-message-bus-object-model-QUESTIONS.md, subsystem-message-bus-tools-QUESTIONS.md):
     - Whether cross-scope parents are allowed (task messages referencing project messages) and how UI resolves them.
     - Whether run-agent bus post should return msg_id for chaining.
   - Related: ideas.md, subsystem-message-bus-tools.md, subsystem-agent-protocol.md, subsystem-monitoring-ui.md

**Planning subsystem spec review**

I'm preparing to read each subsystem spec file systematically to identify contradictions and key details, starting with the orchestration spec, aiming to produce summaries and cross-check with TIPICS for inconsistencies.

# Runner & Orchestration Subsystem

## Overview
This subsystem owns how agents are started, restarted, and coordinated. It defines the `run-agent` binary (implemented in Go, including the `task` and `job` subcommands) responsible for spawning agent runs, tracking lineage, and enforcing the root "Ralph" restart loop until completion.

## Goals
- Start agents with a consistent run layout and metadata (see Storage & Data Layout).
- Track parent-child relationships and restart chains (previous_run_id).
- Keep the root orchestrator running until the task is done (DONE marker).
- Provide a stable CLI for starting tasks and agents.
- Rotate or auto-select agent types to avoid stalling.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing the message bus itself (handled by Message Bus Tooling).
- Implementing the monitoring UI (handled by Monitoring UI).
- Enforcing strict sandboxing or resource limits (not required yet).

## Responsibilities
- Validate required environment variables for run tracking (internal to runner).
- Create run directories and record run metadata.

# Storage & Data Layout Subsystem

## Overview
Defines the on-disk layout under ~/run-agent for projects, tasks, and individual agent runs. This layout is the source of truth for monitoring, recovery, and auditability.

## Goals
- Provide a predictable, human-readable structure.
- Persist task state, facts, and message bus history.
- Allow reconstruction of run trees from disk without external DB.

## Non-Goals
- Long-term archival or retention policies beyond "keep everything".
- Storing large binary artifacts.

## Responsibilities
- Define directory layout and naming conventions.
- Define file formats for run metadata, facts, and state files.
- Specify how agents read/write state and facts.
- Clarify that config.hcl is global only (no per-project/task config files).

# Message Bus Object Model

## Overview
Defines the object schema for structured message relationships in the message bus. This extends the basic parents[] threading mechanism to support richer dependency semantics ("beads"-style relationships) while remaining backward-compatible with simple parent msg_id lists.

## Goals
- Provide a stable schema for structured parents[] entries.
- Allow richer relationships beyond simple replies (e.g., blocks, supersedes).
- Keep compatibility with string-only parents[] entries.

## Non-Goals
- Defining a full issue-tracking workflow.
- Enforcing relationship semantics at runtime (tooling may remain permissive in MVP).

## parents[] Schema
The `parents` header field accepts either:
- A list of strings (msg_id values), or
- A list of objects with relationship metadata.

# Message Bus Tooling Subsystem

## Overview
Provides the run-agent bus CLI and REST conventions for writing to and reading from project/task message buses. The tooling is implemented in the Go `run-agent` binary. Agents must communicate only through the message bus tooling; direct file writes are disallowed.

## Goals
- Provide a consistent append-only message format.
- Enable blocking or polling reads and streaming.
- Support CLI and REST access via the run-agent binary.

## Non-Goals
- Implementing the message bus service beyond the run-agent binary.
- Backward compatibility with legacy single-line formats.

## Responsibilities
- Define message format and required header fields.
- Define run-agent bus post/poll/stream behavior.
- Define message threading (parents[]), filtering, and ordering rules.

## Overview
A TypeScript + React web UI for observing the agent swarm. It is served by the run-agent Go binary (run-agent serve; embedded static assets) and uses the same backend to read the filesystem layout and message bus streams.

## Goals
- Visualize projects, tasks, and run hierarchies from disk layout.
- Display message bus activity in near real-time.
- Show agent output and prompt artifacts per run.
- Provide a guided task creation UI.

## Non-Goals
- Remote multi-user access or authentication (localhost only for MVP).
- Editing task files directly in the UI.
- Full IDE features.
- Multi-host backend selection (planned later).
- Cross-project full-text search across messages and outputs.

## UX Requirements
- Use JetBrains Mono for all text.

- Q: Which build tool should be used for the TypeScript + React UI (Vite, CRA, custom)? | Proposed default: Vite for fast dev and optimized builds. | A: TBD.
- Q: How are frontend assets embedded into the Go binary (go:embed vs external assets)? | Proposed default: go:embed of a built dist folder. | A: TBD.
- Q: What is the API contract between the Go backend and the UI (REST/JSON schemas, SSE event formats), and how are TypeScript types generated? | Proposed default: REST/JSON + SSE; add OpenAPI or manual type sync later. | A: TBD.
- Q: What is the development workflow for the UI (separate dev server with proxy vs embedded only)? | Proposed default: Separate dev server with proxy to Go backend; embed for release. | A: TBD.
- Q: Do we need a state management library (Redux/Zustand) or is React Context sufficient for MVP? | Proposed default: Context + hooks for MVP. | A: TBD.
- Q: How should log streaming be exposed in the backend (per-run SSE endpoint vs polling output.md)? | Proposed default: Per-run SSE when available; polling fallback for MVP. | A: TBD.

# Agent Protocol & Governance Subsystem

## Overview
Defines behavioral rules for all agents in the swarm, including delegation, communication, state/fact updates, and git safety. Enforcement is primarily via prompts and runner tooling, not sandboxing.

## Goals
- Ensure small, focused agent runs that exit on completion.
- Force all communication through message bus tooling.
- Maintain a reliable state/facts trail for handoff.
- Reduce cross-agent conflicts via delegation.

## Non-Goals
- Hard sandbox enforcement or resource limits.
- Strict path boundaries across projects.

## Behavioral Rules
- Agents MUST work on a scoped task and exit when done.
- Agents MUST delegate if a task is too large or outside their folder context.
- Agents SHOULD scope work to a single module/folder and delegate other folders to sub-agents.
- Agents MUST read TASK_STATE.md and message bus on start.

## Overview
Defines the invocation contract between run-agent (Go binary; including `task`/`job`) and spawned agents. This includes internal environment variables used for run tracking, plus the prompt/context injection that agents use to discover paths (task/run folders) without relying on env vars.

## Goals
- Document internal JRUN_* variables for run tracking.
- Document prompt/context injection for run/task paths.
- Clarify that agents should not rely on environment variables for workflow.
- Ensure child processes can find run-agent via PATH.

## Non-Goals
- Standardizing backend token names beyond config injection.
- Enforcing env vars at the OS/sandbox level.
- Providing a full process supervisor API (handled by Runner & Orchestration).

## Responsibilities

# Agent Protocol & Governance - Questions

- Q: How is folder ownership assigned and recorded, and how is it passed to sub-agents?
  Proposed default: Root agent maintains OWNERSHIP.md (path -> owner run_id) and includes owned paths in sub-agent prompts.
  A: There is no OWNDERSHIP.md file. You start `run-agent` command to start sub agent, it manages all the run folders by itself, it adds "RUN_FOLDER=<path>, use this folder for prompts, task outputs, and other temp files. Put the results to $RUN_FOLDER/output.md file" to the beginning of the promots. Together wish base prompts to each runs. So 

- Q: What is the ownership handoff protocol when a parent reassigns paths or a sub-agent finishes?
  Proposed default: Parent posts HANDOFF message to TASK-MESSAGE-BUS with paths + new owner, then updates OWNERSHIP.md and TASK_STATE.md.
  A: Agents are never working with theis paths directly, no need to reassign. There is no OWNDERSHIP.md file.

- Q: Are parent agents allowed to read/monitor child TASK_STATE.md and output during execution?
  Proposed default: Parent may read child TASK_STATE.md/output for monitoring but must not write; all commands via MESSAGE-BUS.
  A: We do not help or block it. It's up the the agent to figure it out.

- Q: Should agents have resource limits (disk writes, network calls, subprocess count), and who enforces them?
  Proposed default: Optional limits defined in config; run-agent enforces pre-flight and logs violations to ISSUES.md.
  A: No. We just run the agent processes.

- Q: What guardrails apply to sensitive paths (~/.ssh, ~/.gnupg, /etc) when no sandbox is enforced?
  Proposed default: Treat as restricted; require explicit user approval via MESSAGE-BUS before read/write; log access.

**Comparing current questions to history**

I'm verifying which current questions remain unanswered by cross-checking them against history files, noting that some questions like parent blocking vs exit and dedicated poller aren't answered yet and still appear in current question files.

/bin/zsh -lc "sed -n '1,240p' questions-history/subsystem-message-bus-tools-QUESTIONS-20260202.md" in /Users/jonnyzzz/Work/jonnyzzz-ai-coder/swarm succeeded in 53ms:
# Message Bus Tooling - Questions

- Q: What are the required header fields for each message entry, and what is the canonical msg_id format?
  Proposed default: Required: msg_id, ts, type, project; optional: task, run_id, parents[]; msg_id = ULID generated by run-agent bus tooling.
  A: Accepted.

- Q: Should tooling read legacy single-line entries, or require YAML front-matter only?
  Proposed default: Read both; new writes always YAML front-matter; provide optional migration tool.
  A: No need for backward compatibility, this is a new tool anyway. Use the right approach.

- Q: What is the exact concurrency/atomicity strategy for appending messages?
  Proposed default: Advisory file lock + append + fsync for new entries; temp+rename only for compaction.
  A: We base it on the run-agent logic, create a temp file first, next swap files. There is low change of conflict, use OS-provided features.

- Q: What ordering guarantees should bus readers assume when multiple agents append concurrently?
  Proposed default: Timestamp ordering only; ties resolved by msg_id; no global FIFO guarantee.
  A: the ID is timestamp + pid, so it's globally unique. Low probability of collision or conflicts is ok.

- Q: Should poll/pager support cursor persistence (e.g., --cursor-file) or leave it entirely to callers?
  Proposed default: Optional --cursor-file storing last msg_id; default caller-managed.

# Monitoring & Control UI - Questions

- Q: When a user enters a task id that already exists, should the UI attach/restart or create a new task with a suffix?
  A: Prompt user; default to restart/attach; offer "Create new with timestamp suffix".

- Q: In aggregated output views, should stdout/stderr be merged or separated?
  A: Merge chronologically with stream tags and color coding; allow quick filter toggle.

- Q: What is the default log tail size and paging behavior for large outputs?
  A: Show last 1MB (or 5k lines) per run; "Load more" fetches older chunks.

- Q: Should message bodies and prompts render as plain text or Markdown in the UI?
  Proposed default: Plain text for MVP; optional Markdown toggle later.
  A: Plain text with JetBrains mono font.

- Q: How should projects/tasks be ordered in the tree (alphabetical vs last activity)?
  A: Order by last activity (most recent first), with alphabetical tiebreakers.

- Q: Should the UI expose run controls (stop/kill/restart) for run nodes or stay read-only?
  Proposed default: Read-only for MVP; controls added later via backend.

# Runner & Orchestration - Questions

- Q: On Ralph restarts, how are root runs linked for UI and recovery (parent/previous chain)?
  A: Each restart creates a new run; run metadata includes previous_run_id to form a chain.

- Q: What locking mechanism prevents concurrent run-task instances for the same task, and how are stale locks recovered?
  Proposed default: task.lock with PID+start time; stale if PID missing or lock age > TTL; allow --force to clear.
  A: We create runId as current timestamp (date, time) and PID. 

- Q: How does “lucky” agent selection persist state across runs (round-robin index, health/degraded backoff)?
  Proposed default: Store last-used index and degraded backends (from backend health TTL cache) in a per-project runner state file.
  A: Use message bus, query it to decide. Every run should include that information.

- Q: How are message-bus pollers identified, deduplicated, and restarted on crash?
  Proposed default: One poller per project/task with pid+heartbeat file; restart if heartbeat stale; log to MESSAGE-BUS.
  A: No need for that, make sure root agent is taking care of that.

- Q: How should orphaned runs be handled when run-agent exits but the agent process continues?
  Proposed default: On supervisor start, scan PIDs; mark orphan if pid alive but no parent; keep monitoring; if pid dead and no exit_code, mark crashed.
  A: We wait for all children to exit before marking a next start.

**Reviewing past decisions**

I'm verifying previous decisions against current specs to identify any discrepancies before checking storage history next.

# Storage & Data Layout - Questions

- Q: What exact timestamp format/timezone should be used for all <timestamp> segments to ensure lexical sort == chronological?
  Proposed default: 
  A: UTC with YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSMMMM-PID (path-safe, sortable; UTC by convention).

- Q: What format should run_id take (ULID/UUIDv7/etc.) and who generates it?
  Proposed default: ULID generated by the runner; used in run folder names and message bus entries.
  A: RunId is generated by run-agent automatically, use UTC with YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSMMMM-PID as sufix

- Q: What are allowed characters/length limits for project IDs and task slugs, and what is the collision strategy?
  Proposed default: slugify to lowercase [a-z0-9-], max 48 chars; on collision append -<4char> hash.
  A: Java Identifier rules. No limit on project ID length.

- Q: What is the intended content/producer for output.md vs agent-stdout.txt/agent-stderr.txt, and which should the UI show by default?
  A: output.md is the final agent response; stdout/stderr are raw streams; UI defaults to output.md with a raw-logs toggle.

- Q: What is the write protocol for root-owned files (TASK_STATE.md, OWNERSHIP.md), and should updates be atomic?
  A: Only root agent writes; use temp write + atomic rename; last writer wins.
