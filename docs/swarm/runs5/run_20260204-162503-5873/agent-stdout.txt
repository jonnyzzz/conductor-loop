I will read the necessary files to understand the current state of the design and the specific topic.
I will check the git history of `TIPICS.md` and `subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md` to see recent changes and context.
Here is the review of Topic 9: Implementation Stack & Build Pipeline.

### 1. External Facts Check
(No Perplexity check required. Standard industry practices for Go/React stacks applied.)

### 2. TIPICS.md Updates
**Topic 9: Implementation Stack & Build Pipeline**
*   **Decisions:**
    *   **Frontend Build:** Vite is the build tool for the TypeScript + React UI (fast dev, optimized production builds).
    *   **Embedding:** `go:embed` is used to bundle the `dist/` folder into the single Go binary.
    *   **Development Workflow:** `run-agent serve --dev` (or similar flag/env) proxies API requests to the Go backend while allowing a separate Vite dev server for HMR.
    *   **State Management:** React Context + Hooks is sufficient for MVP (no Redux/Zustand yet).
    *   **Version Injection:** Binary version/commit hash injected via `go build -ldflags`.
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   (Remove build workflow questions as they are resolved above.)
    *   Automated CI/CD pipeline specifics (GitHub Actions vs others) for cross-platform builds.

**Topic 10: Frontend-Backend API Contract**
*   **Decisions:**
    *   **Type Generation:** Manual synchronization for MVP; consider `openapi-generator` or Go-to-TS tools post-MVP.

### 3. Spec Updates
**`subsystem-monitoring-ui.md`**
*   **Overview / Tech Stack:** Explicitly mention **Vite** as the build tool.
*   **Development:** Add a section on "Development Workflow" describing the proxy setup (Vite dev server -> Go backend).
*   **State Management:** Explicitly state "React Context + Hooks" for local state.

**`subsystem-runner-orchestration.md`**
*   **Components / run-agent serve:** Mention that it serves assets via `go:embed`.
*   **Configuration:** Confirm HCL schema is embedded/validated by the binary.
*   **Build:** Add a brief "Build & Release" note about `ldflags` versioning and `go:embed`.

### 4. Questions to Remove/Resolve
**`subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md`**
*   **Q:** Which build tool should be used...?
    *   **Resolution:** **Vite**. Standard modern choice for React.
*   **Q:** How are frontend assets embedded...?
    *   **Resolution:** **`go:embed`**. Native Go capability, simplest single-binary distribution.
*   **Q:** What is the development workflow...?
    *   **Resolution:** **Proxy**. Run Vite dev server for frontend, proxy API calls to running `run-agent` backend.
*   **Q:** Do we need a state management library...?
    *   **Resolution:** **No (Context + Hooks)**. MVP complexity is low enough.
*   **Q:** What is the API contract... and type generation?
    *   **Resolution:** **REST/JSON + SSE**. Types manually synced for MVP.

**`subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md`**
*   **Q:** How are run-agent binary updates... handled?
    *   **Resolution:** **Manual install** for MVP.
*   **Q:** Where is the config.hcl schema... defined?
    *   **Resolution:** **Hardcoded in Go structs** (using `hcl` tags) and validated on load.

### 5. New Open Questions
**`subsystem-runner-orchestration-QUESTIONS.md`**
*   **Q:** Should we implement a `run-agent version` command that prints build details (commit, date)? | **Proposed default:** Yes, essential for debugging. | **A:** TBD.
*   **Q:** CI/CD: Do we provide pre-built binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows? | **Proposed default:** Yes, via GitHub Actions releases. | **A:** TBD.
