I will begin by reading the relevant documentation and design specification files to understand the current state of the Environment Variable & Invocation Contract.
I have reviewed Topic 7 and the relevant specifications. Here is the assessment and proposed updates.

### 1) External facts check
*   **Go `filepath.Clean`**: Confirmed standard library function for OS-native path cleaning.
*   **ISO-8601**: Standard international date format (e.g., `2026-02-04T12:00:00Z`).
*   **SIGTERM/SIGKILL**: Standard Unix signals for termination (15) and kill (9).

### 2) TIPICS.md updates
*   **Decisions**:
    *   **Time Injection**: `run-agent` injects the current date/time (ISO-8601 UTC) into the prompt preamble so agents are temporally aware.
    *   **Path Formatting**: Paths injected into prompts (like `RUN_FOLDER`) are absolute and OS-native (using Go's `filepath.Clean`) to ensure commands generated by the agent work directly in the local shell.
    *   **Environment Inheritance**: Agents inherit the full parent environment by default in MVP, augmented with `JRUN_*` vars and backend tokens.
    *   **Signal Handling**: Runner sends `SIGTERM` to the agent's process group, waits 30 seconds for cleanup (flushing message bus/state), then sends `SIGKILL`.
    *   **Standard Variables**: Explicitly listed `JRUN_PROJECT_ID`, `JRUN_TASK_ID`, `JRUN_ID`, `JRUN_PARENT_ID` as read-only internal variables.

### 3) Spec updates
*   **subsystem-env-contract.md**:
    *   Add section **Time Injection**: Mandate `CURRENT_DATE_TIME` (ISO-8601 UTC) in the prompt preamble.
    *   Update **Prompt/Context Injection**: Specify that `RUN_FOLDER` and other paths must be absolute and OS-native.
    *   Update **Internal Environment Variables**: Add note about Full Inheritance from the parent process (MVP decision).
    *   Add **Signal Handling Contract**: Document the SIGTERM -> 30s -> SIGKILL flow, cross-referencing `subsystem-runner-orchestration.md`.

### 4) Questions to remove/resolve
*   **subsystem-env-contract-QUESTIONS.md**:
    *   `Q: How are paths normalized...` -> **Resolve**: OS-native using Go `filepath.Clean` (absolute paths) to support copy-paste into shell.
    *   `Q: Does the agent process inherit...` -> **Resolve**: Full inheritance in MVP to support standard tools/git without configuration overhead.
    *   `Q: What is the signal handling contract...` -> **Resolve**: SIGTERM process group -> 30s wait -> SIGKILL.
    *   `Q: Should the current date/time be injected...` -> **Resolve**: Yes, ISO-8601 UTC in prompt preamble.

### 5) New open questions
*   **subsystem-env-contract-QUESTIONS.md**:
    *   `Q: Should we scrub sensitive variables (like SSH_AUTH_SOCK or AWS_*) from the inherited environment in post-MVP?` / **Proposed default**: Yes, utilize an allowlist in future versions. / **A**: TBD.
    *   `Q: Do we need a JRUN_AGENT_TYPE variable for self-awareness?` / **Proposed default**: Yes, useful for logic that depends on model capabilities. / **A**: TBD.
