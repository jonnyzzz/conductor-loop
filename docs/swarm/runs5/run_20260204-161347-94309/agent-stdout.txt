Now let me compile my findings:

## Review Report: Monitoring & Control UI Subsystem

### 1) External Facts Check

**Status:** Perplexity MCP authentication failed (401 error - consistent with ISSUES.md entry). However, I can confirm from my knowledge cutoff (January 2025) that all technical claims in the spec are factually correct:

- **Vite**: Standard build tool for React/TypeScript projects ✓
- **go:embed**: Standard Go feature for embedding static assets in binaries ✓
- **SSE vs WebSocket**: SSE is correct for unidirectional server-to-client streaming; simpler than WebSocket ✓
- **React Context**: Sufficient for simple state management without Redux/Zustand ✓
- **JetBrains Mono**: Valid monospace font suitable for development UIs ✓

No external fact-checking required beyond these well-established technologies.

### 2) Spec Updates

**subsystem-monitoring-ui.md:**
- Add explicit mention that backend computes run status (already present at line 80 but could be clearer in Status & Indicators section)
- Clarify that output.md is the default view with raw logs as a toggle (currently line 73 mentions tail size but doesn't explicitly state default view precedence; storage spec confirms output.md is canonical)
- Add note about local storage autosave for prompt editor to prevent data loss (mentioned in line 54)
- Document that filesystem watchers are preferred over polling (line 88)

**subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md:**
- File shows "No open questions at this time" but should actually list the 8 build/implementation questions from the archived version
- The current QUESTIONS file is misleading - it suggests all questions are resolved when implementation details are still TBD

### 3) Questions to Remove/Resolve

**From subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md (current version):**

All questions in this file were REMOVED in commit 5efa144 (2026-02-03) and replaced with "No open questions at this time."

**From questions-history/subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS-20260202.md (archived version):**

All 9 questions in the archived version WERE ANSWERED:
1. Task ID collision → **RESOLVED**: Prompt user; default to restart/attach
2. stdout/stderr merge → **RESOLVED**: Merge chronologically with stream tags and color coding
3. Log tail size → **RESOLVED**: Show last 1MB or 5k lines
4. Plain text vs Markdown → **RESOLVED**: Plain text with JetBrains Mono
5. Tree ordering → **RESOLVED**: Order by last activity (most recent first)
6. Run controls → **RESOLVED**: Read-only for MVP
7. Real-time states → **RESOLVED**: Status badges from backend (2s refresh)
8. localhost vs LAN auth → **RESOLVED**: localhost only, no token auth, served from run-agent binary
9. Search/filter → **RESOLVED**: Browse-only for MVP; search later

**These should remain resolved and NOT be reopened.**

### 4) New Open Questions

**subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md should be updated with:**

```markdown
# Monitoring & Control UI - Questions

- Q: Which build tool should be used for the TypeScript + React UI (Vite, CRA, custom)? | Proposed default: Vite for fast dev and optimized builds. | A: TBD.
- Q: How are frontend assets embedded into the Go binary (go:embed vs external assets)? | Proposed default: go:embed of a built dist folder. | A: TBD.
- Q: What is the API contract between the Go backend and the UI (REST/JSON schemas, SSE event formats), and how are TypeScript types generated? | Proposed default: REST/JSON + SSE; add OpenAPI or manual type sync later. | A: TBD.
- Q: What is the development workflow for the UI (separate dev server with proxy vs embedded only)? | Proposed default: Separate dev server with proxy to Go backend; embed for release. | A: TBD.
- Q: Do we need a state management library (Redux/Zustand) or is React Context sufficient for MVP? | Proposed default: Context + hooks for MVP. | A: TBD.
```

**Rationale:** These are implementation-level questions that are distinct from the UX/behavior questions that were resolved. TIPICS.md Topic 9 and 10 acknowledge these are open.

### 5) New Docs/Topics Suggested

**No new dedicated docs needed.** However:

**Cross-cutting concerns identified:**
1. **Topic 10 (Frontend-Backend API Contract)** in TIPICS.md correctly identifies the API contract as an open area but has minimal detail. Consider expanding this topic once implementation starts.
2. **Output display precedence**: The spec mentions both output.md (canonical) and raw stdout/stderr but doesn't clearly state the UI default. Storage spec (subsystem-storage-layout.md:41) says output.md is canonical response. UI spec should explicitly state: "Default view shows output.md; toggle to view raw stdout/stderr logs."

**Contradictions found:**
- **NONE**: All decisions are consistent between ideas.md, TIPICS.md, and the monitoring UI spec.

**Missing decisions/clarifications:**
- Output pane should default to output.md with optional toggle to raw logs (implicit from storage spec but not explicit in UI spec)
- When "Start Task" is pressed, the UI should use `run-agent task` not `run-task.sh` (correctly stated in spec line 58)
- Attachment path rendering (line 69) is mentioned but no detail on how backend serves these files (implicit: backend provides file serving endpoint)

---

## Summary

**Contradictions:** None found.

**Answered questions ready for spec integration:** All 9 UX/behavior questions from the archived QUESTIONS file were answered and integrated into subsystem-monitoring-ui.md.

**New open questions identified:** 5 implementation/build questions that should be added to subsystem-monitoring-ui-QUESTIONS.md.

**Spec is mature:** The monitoring UI subsystem spec is well-defined for MVP. The remaining questions are implementation details that can be resolved during development without affecting the design.
