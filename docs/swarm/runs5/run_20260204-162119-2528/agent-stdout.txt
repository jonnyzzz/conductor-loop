I will read the core documentation and git history for the "Message Bus Object Model" to identify updates and resolve questions.
1) External facts check
No external facts need verification. The scope is internal data modeling.

2) Spec updates
*   **subsystem-message-bus-object-model.md**
    *   **Clarify validation:** Explicitly state that tooling MUST NOT validate `kind` values against the "Suggested" list and MUST NOT log warnings for unknown kinds (enforcing the "free-form" decision).
    *   **Casing convention:** Add a recommendation that `kind` SHOULD be `snake_case` (e.g., `relates_to`, `supersedes`) to maintain consistency, though tooling treats it as an opaque case-sensitive string.

3) Questions to remove/resolve
*   **subsystem-message-bus-object-model-QUESTIONS.md**
    *   **Q:** Should tooling validate `kind` values against a known list or allow free-form strings?
    *   **Resolution:** **No validation.** The spec defines `kind` as free-form with no fixed vocabulary. Tooling must be permissive to support future relationship types without code changes.

4) New open questions
*   **subsystem-message-bus-object-model-QUESTIONS.md**
    *   **Q:** Should we reserve a namespace (e.g., `sys:*` or `core:*`) for `kind` values to prevent collisions with future protocol-level semantics?
        *   **Proposed default:** No reservation in MVP; rely on `snake_case` conventions.
        *   **A:** TBD.

5) New docs/topics suggested
None. The existing spec covers the scope adequately.
