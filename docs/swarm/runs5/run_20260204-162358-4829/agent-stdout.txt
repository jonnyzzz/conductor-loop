I will read the core documentation and history files to understand the current state of Agent Governance & Delegation.
This is a review of Topic 4: Agent Governance & Delegation.

### 1. External Facts Check
*   No external verifications required. "Ralph" and "Git Pro" are internal project terms.

### 2. TIPICS.md Updates
*   **Update "Agent Governance & Delegation" Decisions:**
    *   **Blocking Behavior:** Non-root agents **MUST** block (wait) when delegating to sub-agents (`run-agent` calls are synchronous). Only the **Root** agent operates as a restartable state machine (managed by Ralph) that can exit and resume.
    *   **Git Safety:** Confirmed as "Soft Governance" via prompt guidance (e.g., "Git Pro" persona), not hard restrictions.
    *   **Run Folder Ownership:** Reiterate that `OWNERSHIP.md` is deprecated; ownership is implicitly defined by the `RUN_FOLDER` path injected into the prompt.
*   **Update "Agent Governance & Delegation" Open Questions:**
    *   Remove "Parent blocking vs. exit behavior" (Resolved: Non-roots block, Root restarts).

### 3. Spec Updates
*   **`subsystem-agent-protocol.md`**
    *   Add a section or bullet under **Behavioral Rules**:
        *   "**Delegation Blocking:** Non-root agents MUST block and wait for child agents to complete. They cannot exit and expect to be restarted. Only the Root agent is subject to the Ralph restart loop."
    *   Refine **Run Folder Ownership**: Explicitly state "No `OWNERSHIP.md` file exists. Ownership is managed by the prompt context." (This aligns with the text but clarifies the removal of the file artifact).

### 4. Questions to Remove/Resolve
*   **File:** `subsystem-agent-protocol-QUESTIONS.md`
    *   **Q:** When a parent agent delegates to a sub-agent, must the parent block...?
    *   **Resolution:** **Yes**, non-root parents must block. If they exit, the delegation chain is broken (no recursive restart for sub-agents). Only the Root agent may exit and rely on Ralph to restart it.

### 5. New Open Questions
*   **File:** `subsystem-agent-protocol-QUESTIONS.md`
    *   **Q:** How should "Zombie" runs (orphaned sub-agents whose blocking parent crashed) be handled?
        *   *Proposed default:* Ralph (Root supervisor) detects orphaned descendants during its scan and terminates them, or leaves them to complete if they are detached safe jobs.
        *   *A:* TBD.
