- Q: Where should attachment files referenced by attachment_path be stored (task folder, run folder, shared attachments/)? Any cleanup policy?
  A: No cleanup policy is needed right now. Attachments are stored in the task folder, must be named accordingly with timespamp (the same format)  plus a short description.
